Modification and update of Plateau's LED ticker software to work with my ticker.

23/03/22 Change log:
- Auto detection of running game.
- Added support for 28 and 29.
- updated 13 address for clean bm2dx.exe
- removed game selection GUI, depricated due to auto detection.

Backlog: 
- Spice API option.
- Work through older styles (10-16) to find addresses for clean bm2dx.exe's
- implement support for 24-27

Bugs:
Crashes on game exit. Would prefer it to detect game close and go back into auto detect mode. 

64bit exe for 10-16, 25-current
32bit exe is required for 17-24
